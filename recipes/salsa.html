    <h2>This is salsa is not for the faint of heart</h2>
    <p>This is my go to salsa recipe. It is very easy to make and it's not just super spicy, it is deliciously flavorful. If you love spicy foods, you won't be dissapointed. I'll stop talking now because I personally can't stand when a recipe doesn't get to the point. Try it out! </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1/4 cup oil</li>
    <li>1 slicing tomato</li>
    <li>1/2 white onion</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
    <li>1 cup dried chiles de arbol</li>
    <li>2 tbsp salt</li>

</ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Add oil to large pan and turn to high heat</li>
        <li>Cut tomatoe into chunks and add to oil</li>
        <li>Cut onion into small chunks and add to oil</li>
        <li>Add garlic cloves and chiles to oil</li>
        <li>Once tomatoes are hot and before chiles start to burn, add entire contents of pan to blender</li>
        <li>Add salt and blend on high for 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Check consistency and taste and add water if too thick or too spicy and blend again. Or enjoy as is!</li>

    </ol>
